# CMOS Operational Amplifier Design
## Introduction  
This project implements a **two-stage CMOS operational amplifier** using the **MC14007UB** MOS transistor array. Completed as a collaborative effort by a team of three, the design explores both the differential and common-mode characteristics of a CMOS op-amp constructed from discrete NMOS and PMOS transistors. A sinusoidal input generated by a function generator is applied, and the output behavior is characterized through simulation (*OrCAD*) and bench measurements using an oscilloscope. Performance metrics include differential-mode gain, common-mode gain, common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), and high-frequency response.

## Project Overview  
- **Transistor Characterization:** Parameters such as threshold voltage, output resistance, and transconductance were extracted from device curves to model small-signal behavior.  
- **Circuit Design:** The amplifier consists of a differential pair, active load, current mirror, and gain stage, with optional Miller compensation to stabilize high-frequency operation.  
- **Simulation:** SPICE-based OrCAD simulations were used to evaluate frequency response, validate theoretical gain, and confirm pole-zero behavior.  
- **Measurement:** The circuit was physically built using MC14007 packages. Bias currents and node voltages were tuned using precision trimpots. Frequency sweeps and output waveforms were captured using lab instrumentation to verify amplifier functionality.

## Conclusion  
The CMOS op-amp demonstrated robust differential-mode performance and effective common-mode suppression when properly biased. Differences between simulation and lab results highlight the sensitivity of analog circuits to real-world conditions such as power supply variation, transistor mismatches, different resistor values, and parasitic capacitance introduced by the oscilloscope probe. The project reinforced practical design considerations and provided insight into the analog behavior of CMOS transistor-level amplifiers.
